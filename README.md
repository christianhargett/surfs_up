# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

### In this challenge we are considering investing in building a "Surf 'n Shake" shop in Oahu, Hawaii. We have found an investor, W. Avy, who is seriously considering investing in our shop. However, W. Avy wants us to run some analytics on the weather in Oahu before he invests. W. Avy wants us to take a look at the temperature trends in June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business can be sustainable year round.

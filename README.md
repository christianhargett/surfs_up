# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

### In this challenge we are considering investing in building a "Surf 'n Shake" shop in Oahu, Hawaii. We have found an investor, W. Avy, who is seriously considering investing in our shop. However, W. Avy wants us to run some analytics on the weather in Oahu before he invests. W. Avy wants us to take a look at the temperature trends in June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business can be sustainable year round. 

## Results

### After querying temperature observation data from all weather stations in Oahu, we filtered for data in the month of June (across all years) and generated some summary statistics (pictured below):

### After looking at this information we can determine that the temperature data for Oahu in June is favorable for a surf and ice cream shop business. This notion is supported by the below data point:

### 1)The average temperature in June is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
### 2) The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees Fahrenheit.
### 3) The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 
### We also queried for the exact same data except we filtered for the month of December (pictured below):

### With this information we can determine that our temperature data for December might help us convince W. Avy that Oahu is a good location for our business. The data points that support this are below:

### 1) The average temperature in December is 71 degrees Fahrenheit.
### 2) The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees Fahrenheit.
### 3) The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Summary

### While temperature preferences obviously vary from person to person, the temperature range is still favorable for surfing and consuming ice cream. Just from looking at temperature data in the middle of summer and the middle of winter for Oahu, it appears that the temperature stays relatively warm all year round. This conclusion helps us convince W. Avy that the surf and ice cream shop business would be successful due to favorable year round weather conditions. Temperature, however, is not the only factor in determining that the weather in Oahu is good enough year round to support our business. In order to provide W. Avy with more supporting exploratory analyis, we might want to perform a query that shows summary statistics for the precipation in Oahu for June and December. Additionally, we might want to query for humidity for June and December as well.

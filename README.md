# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

### In this challenge we are considering investing in building a "Surf 'n Shake" shop in Oahu, Hawaii. We have found an investor, W. Avy, who is seriously considering investing in our shop. However, W. Avy wants us to run some analytics on the weather in Oahu before he invests. W. Avy wants us to take a look at the temperature trends in June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business can be sustainable year round. 

## Results

### After querying temperature observation data from all weather stations in Oahu, we filtered for data in the month of June (across all years) and generated some summary statistics (pictured below):

### After looking at this information we can determine that the temperature data for Oahu in June is favorable for a surf and ice cream shop business. The average temperature in June is 75 degrees Fahrenheit, while the minimum temperature is 64 degrees. The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees. While temperature preferences obviously vary from person to person, the temperature range is still favorable for surfing and consumung ice cream.
